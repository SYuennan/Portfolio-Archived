    <h1 class="element-container header-contents">Project Description</h1>

    <div class="justify-centered-left-body-content">
        <p>Project Lost Bunker is a Virtual Reality project that incorporates the Oculus Rift system to determine
            whether different people can reach the same amount of presence when placed in the same situation. Presence
            is when the user feel as if they are present in that world as a physical entity and it was conveyed to the
            users through a keen attention to the design and detail of this virtual experience. This project was created
            within a development time of 2 months and was created with 3 other people: Daria Kilmaseva (Co-scene
            designer), Rozhin Kardan (Co-3D modelling artist), and Lee McHale (Co-programmer).

    <h1 class="element-container header-contents">Role</h1>
    <div class="justify-centered-left-body-content">
        <p>
            My role for this project were mainly as the project lead and programmer. As the lead, I assessed my team’s
            experience with the techniques we’d be using for the projects as well as their motivations and eagerness to
            move forward with the project. From this, I assigned tasks for them that wouldn’t overwhelm them but rather
            challenge them whilst maintaining a healthy balance between this project and their other courses.I also
            became the team’s main supporting figure, providing advice and assistance regarding the project whenever my
            team members needed it. As the programmer, my task was to create an interaction system that can work with
            any paired objects and it should be easy to use for non-programming roles as well.

    <h1 class="element-container header-contents">Problem</h1>

    <div class="element-container">
        <div class="justify-body-content">
            <p>
                The problem I faced was the different possibilities of how to detect two different Unity objects to
                interact with one another while also being treated as separate entities. One solution that I considered
                was simply group them into one object and turn on trigger collision for both objects when they are
                within close proximity within each other. This would require 2 different trigger collisions to work
                which makes it impractical and clumsy.

        <div class="justify-body-content">
            <p>
                The alternate solution that I ended up using was to assign each object with a datatype using enum using
                one trigger collision. Each object is then paired in a key-system. For example, if an object is assigned
                with a "bronze key", then the only corresponding "bronze door" would work and nothing else. Upon
                collision the key object would be destroyed and the door would play an animation using mecanim.

        <p>
            What I learned from this project was that there are many solutions to an issue and many paths can be taken
            to successfully solve a problem. However, only well-thought and planned out solutions would lead to better
            implementations in terms of correctness and maintainability. Each solution must be implemented while being
            aware of any future development work on the project. Going for a simpler solution might be easier to
            implement but it may lead to major and conflicting issues later on that can break your program completely. A
            solution needs to be thoughtful, not only for my own use, but it also needs to accommodate intuitive
            techniques so that those without advanced programming knowledge can clearly understand the implementation of
            the solution.
