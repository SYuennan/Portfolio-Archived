            Project Hole-in-One is a work-in-progress arcade mobile game that takes the concept of golf and improvises
            with an artistic narrative experience. This project is done with Maimo Interactive, a team of three members.
            My responsibilities for this project lie in 3D asset and level design. The goal for this project for me is
            to gain knowledge in game design and experience the overall development on an industry level. This also
            includes the planning, iterative, and testing stages as well.

            As the 3D artist, I'm tasked with creating animals in a cubic style and animate them in a way that engages
            players through an effective use of character animation. For example, instead of having each animal move
            realistically I decided to animate their movements more freely, movements that are not restraint by joints
            but as a cubic entity.

            As the level designer, I decided to control how the player would progress the game. With this in mind,
            progressive difficulty is needed. This means that earlier levels has to teach the player important mechanics
            and these would be introduced on a set interval of levels. For every mechanic introduced it has to be eased
            in for the players to slowly get used to it.

            <p>
                The issue I had with the level design is how to control a players action. This is critical because
                giving the players too much freedom can cause inconsistencies with other levels. One thing that I always
                kept in mind is how to make the levels unexploitable since the mechanics in this game gives the players
                so much freedom of movement, there are many ways that the players can easily exploit the game. For
                example, every level I want the players to progress the game in a certain way, but if Iâ€™m not careful
                they can skip through all the obstacles placed and not experiencing the game how I wish the players to
                experience it.

                Before beginning the initial design of each level, I planned out a list of each mechanic that will be
                involved in completing the level. Additionally, I drew a level progression path to simulate how a player
                should move and progress. Adding in the list of applicable mechanics from the planning stage, it made
                the designs of each level more consistent and complete.

        <p>
            This project taught me about how complex a simple process such as level design can be. There are many
            different factors to consider and each decision will lead to mistakes in the design. In this case, I relied
            a lot on planning and acquiring feedback from the other members to see if the levels were exploitable. This
            role is heavy on iterative processes to successfully develop but it provides an effective way to practice
            level design on a more complex scale.
