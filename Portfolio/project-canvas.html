    <div class="justify-centered-left-body-content">
        <p>Canvas is a mobile arcade game in the form of an "endless runner". This was an individual project for the
            class Advanced Game Design. It is designed to attract a wider range of users and uses simplified controls
            and mechanics to do so.This game was created using Unity 3D, and the asset modeling is created through
            Blender (3D), and Clip Studio (2D).

                The problem I encountered the implementation of random generation in each level. One of the solutions
                considered was to simply have a preset of obstacles placed and simply randomized between the presets of
                objects. The presets had to be able to destroy itself once the player reaches a checkpoint while
                continuing to generate obstacles while the player progressed. However, this solution is impractical
                because it will eventually become too predictable for experienced players.

                The solution that I used was to rely on completely math, placing obstacles after defining its range of
                position from the player and from each obstacle. Furthermore, I placed them into a single object so that
                each generated "set" are considered as their own unique obstacles. Realizing that this idea is reusable
                on different assets, I applied the same method to randomize environmental props as well. Using this
                method, it allows minimum effort to create "presets" and completely rely on the program to generate the
                position of the assets. As for how each object are generated and destroyed, I simply placed a large
                trigger collision for when the character passes through. When the player triggers the collision, the
                program destroys the assets that are out of view and then generate new ones ahead.. These triggers are
                placed within each grouped object as separate objects so that they are unaffected by random generation
                but will also get created when a new set of obstacles are generated.

            I learn that there are many ways to simulate random generations, and the importance of being able to reuse
            certain assets in order to create less work with the most efficiency. For example, which asset uses random
            generations can immensely affect the gameplay and the end result.

            This entire project was filled with hardship mostly due to my lack of Unity and programming experience. With
            a difficult time limit I had to learn almost everything from the beginning and execute them within the 1
            month period. However, the experience that I had learnt from this made me realized this is what I truly wish
            to do as a career. I learn the entire game-development process and how important it is to iterate as I work
            as well.
