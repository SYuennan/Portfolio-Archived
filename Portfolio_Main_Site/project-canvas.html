        <p> This project was an arcade mobile game in a form of an "endless runner" with simple controls and mechanics
            that can be picked up and played by non-gamers. This game was created using Unity 3D. The 3D art assets were
            created using Blender, while the 2D assets were created using Clip Studio.

            The development time for this project was one month from 4 months and with a team of 4.
            It becomes a massive issue as my experience was not at
            the level I was comfortable with to create such a project and I didn't have a team to rely on.
            With such a small development window, I had to manage my time
            carefully. Not only I had to design the game with the players in mind but my own abilities and limitations
            as well. This would mean that my own creativity in designs would be hindered by my skills.

                The condition I set for myself is that it must have a core loop that is small and engaging
                enough for the players. While the programming tasks must be within my skill level.
                Lastly, it should look polished with appealing aesthetic to create a visual appeal.

                Following these 3 principles, I was able to finish the project in time with a positive feedback
                and amazements by both my peers and professor to be able to pull of a project in such a handicapped
                situation. Although there were still some concerns with the design, they can easily be solved.
