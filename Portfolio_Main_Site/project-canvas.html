        <p>Canvas is a mobile arcade game in the form of an "endless runner". It is designed to attract a wider range of
            users, and uses simplified controls and mechanics to do so.This game was created using Unity 3D, and the
            asset modeling is created through Blender (3D), and Clip Studio (2D).

                The development time for this project was one month from 4 months and with a team of 4. It became a
                massive issue as my experience was not at the level I was comfortable with to create such a project and
                the team I worked with were causing massive delays in the project.. With such a small development
                window, I had to manage my time carefully. Not only did I have to design the game with the players in
                mind but consider my own abilities and limitations as well. This would mean that the creative
                expectations of canvas would not be met through a lack of skill.

                The condition I set for myself is to restrict the game through a small core loop that manages to be
                engaging players.. The rest of the development cycle was spend in making the assets look polished,
                adding appealing aesthetics to create a visual appeal.

            Following these principles, I was able to finish the project in time with positive feedback and compliments
            by both peers and the course staff. While the projects was done with challenging conditions, it continued to
            be a valuable lesson on balancing the complexity and design of the game design process.. Although there were
            still some concerns with the design, they can easily be solved by continuing development in this project.
