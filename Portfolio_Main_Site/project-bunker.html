    <div class="justify-centered-left-body-content">
        <p>Bunker is a Virtual Reality project that incorporated the Oculus Rift to determine whether different people
            can reach the same amount of presence when placed in the same situation. Presence is { explain presence
            here} and it was conveyed to the users through a keen attention to the design and detail of this virtual
            experience. This project was created within a development time of 2 months and was created with 3 other
            people, Daria Kilmaseva (Co-scene designer), Rozhin Kardan (Co-3D modelling artist), and Lee McHale
            (Co-programmer).

    <h1 class="element-container header-contents">Role</h1>
    <div class="justify-centered-left-body-content">
        <p>
            My role for this project was mainly as the project head of the project. As the lead, I assessed my team’s
            experience with the techniques we’d be using for the projects as well as their motivations and eagerness to
            move forward with the project. From this, I assigned tasks for them that wouldn’t overwhelm them but rather
            challenge them whilst maintaining a healthy balance between this project and their other courses.I also
            became the team’s main supporting figure, providing advice and assistance regarding the project whenever my
            team members needed it.. This method worked well, as this keeps the team's morale high and allowed the
            project to continue smoothly, despite having very little experience in Unity 3D.

    <h1 class="element-container header-contents">Problem</h1>

    <div class="element-container">
        <div class="justify-body-content">
            <p>
                The problem our team first encountered was that our team had little to no prior experience in using
                Unity, which was the main program that we used to develop Bunker. While our class handled a few lessons
                on the Unity engine, it was not enough to complete a complete virtual experience within the allotted
                time. While efforts were made in trying to learn how to use Unity with little amount of time,
                unfortunately it was not enough to cover everything we needed for the project.

                There were two different solutions I did to help my teammates. First, I provided advice on using Unity
                3D to develop components of the project that our class had not cover. Specific examples include: the
                suggested polycounts for models, how lighting works in Unity, and explaining an effective workflow when
                developing a project of this scope. This was helpful as it allowed my teammates have valuable
                contributions to the project while lacking the fundamentals to do so.. The second solution was that I
                handled all the difficult tasks myself in order to continue to maintain the level of detail I wanted
                this project to have. In the end, this was a valuable learning experience as it taught me a lot about
                techniques within the Unity engine.

        <p>
            VR technology is very delicate and methodical work. The user's experience becomes everything, and a lot more
            elements had to be considered. For example, the size of the props or the movement controls. When in VR the
            user could easily experience motion sickness if done incorrectly. Our team tried to avoid this as much as we
            can through intensive testing to make sure that it does not cause harm to our participants.
