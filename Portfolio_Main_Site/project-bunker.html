        <p>This project was a Virtual Reality project using the Oculus Rift as the medium. The project's objective was
            to research more about whether a person can reach the same amount of presence they do when they are in the
            same situation. With a development time of 2 months, this project was created with 3 other people, Daria
            Kilmaseva (Co-scene designer), Rozhin Kardan (Co-3D modelling artist), and Lee McHale (Co-programmer).

            My role for this project was the project manager, co-scene designer, co-modelling artist, and co-programmer.
            As the project manager, I had to gauge my team member's experiences and their motivations to do the project.
            From this, I try to assign tasks for them that will not stress them out along with keeping in mind that they
            have other classes to attend as well. I also noted that should they have any trouble at all with the project
            or the amount of work, I asked that they should tell me immediately and I would fill in the tasks they could
            not do. This method worked well, as this keeps the team's morale high despite having very little experience
            in Unity 3D.

                The problem, our team first encountered was that our team had no prior experience in using Unity. While
                our class handled some lessons using Unity, however, it was not enough to complete the project. While
                efforts were made in trying to learn how to use Unity with little amount of time, unfortunately it was
                not enough to cover everything we needed for the project.

                There were two different solutions I did to help my teammates. First, I tutored them on how to use Unity
                3D on things our class had not cover. Such as the suggested polycounts for models, how lighting works in
                Unity, and how the workflow should look like. This was helpful for my teammates as they were able to
                slowly lighten my load on the amount of tasks I had to do. The second solution was that I handled all
                the difficult tasks myself in order to save time. This was inevitable, but I certainly did not mind it
                because I thought of it as improving my skills using Unity.

            VR technology is very delicate and methodical work. The user's experience becomes everything, and a lot more
            elements had to be considered. For example, the size of the props or the movement controls. When in VR the
            user could easily experience motion sickness if done incorrectly. Our team tried to avoid this as much as we
            can through intensive testing to make sure that it does not cause harm to our participants.
