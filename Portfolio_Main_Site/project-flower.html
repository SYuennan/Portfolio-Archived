        <p>Flower Diary isa 2D side scrolling adventure game with an emphasis on creating a compulsive storytelling
            experience. This project was a collaborative effort and is my introduction to the video game development
            process.. While the time of development was only 3 weeks,the combined effort of 3 people, Nicco Pucci
            (Co-Programmer), Yitian Zhang (Co-Programmer), and Zhixiu Zhu (Artist) were able to create a full featured
            game.

            My roles for this project was the project manager, game designer, and 2D animator. As the project manager,
            my responsibility for my team is to keep track of everyone's task and decide the time frame of which a task
            should be finish. Time management in this project was key, as this was our team's first experience with the
            Unity 3D engine.
            One challenge that our team faced during development was getting around the constraints of the Live2D
            engine.. The Live2D engine is not designed to be used for creating gameplay sequences,but as a supporting
            tool, adding visual aesthetics such as creating livelier backgrounds.

        <div class="justify-body-content">
            <p>
                The issue I faced with my task was the 2D animation part. I used the Live2D Engine for 2D animations as
                part
                of gameplay. However,
                this engine was not meant to be used to create as part of gameplay but as a visual aesthetic such as
                creating movements in the background.
                Live2D Engines are mostly used to create animations for a 2D character portrait, and again for visual
                aesthetic.

    <h1 class="element-container header-contents">Solution</h1>

    <div class="element-container">

        <div class="justify-body-content"> <img src="Resources/Protagonist.gif" class="project-screenshot"
                id="protagonist" alt="project-flower-protagonist">
        </div>

        <div class="justify-body-content">
            <p>
                To get around this constraint, I worked on the character animation as if it was animated through a
                animation program. I translated body parts manually at a certain time frames to create movement. This
                also includes the hair of the character which I split into multiple sections to simulate a flowing
                movement instead of moving the entire hair. Then I export the animation in png frames and construct them
                in Unity as animation by frames.

        <p>
            Adapting the same skill-set through a variety of different engines proved to be effective. In this case, I
            emulated the animation of Live2D into the Unity engine.. With positive feedback about the animations from
            the professors and peers. While the Live2D engine is not necessarily known for game development, it was used
            with the appropriate knowledge to produce fantastic results.
