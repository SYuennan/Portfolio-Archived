          <p>This project was an arcade mobile game in a form of an "endless runner" with simple controls and mechanics
              that can be picked up and played by non-gamers. This game was created using Unity 3D. The 3D art assets were

              <p>
                  The development time for this project was one month from 4 months and with a team of 4. It becomes a
                  massive
                  issue as my experience was not at the level I was comfortable with to create such a project and I didn't
                  have a team to rely on. With such a small development window, I had to manage my time carefully. Not
                  only I
                  had to design the game with the players in mind but my own abilities and limitations as well. This would
                  mean that my own creativity in designs would be hindered by my skills.

                  The condition I set for myself is that it must have a core loop that is small and engaging enough for
                  the players. While the programming tasks must be within my skill level. Lastly, it should look polished
                  with appealing aesthetic to create a visual appeal.

              Following these 3 principles, I was able to finish the project in time with a positive feedback and
              amazements by both my peers and professor to be able to pull of a project in such a handicapped situation.
              Although there were still some concerns with the design, they can easily be solved.

          <p>This project was a 2D side scrolling adventure type game with an emphasis on a narrative-story based
              experience as well as its gameplay. This project was my first full video game project. While the time of
              development was only 3 weeks, with a combined effort of 3 other people, Nicco Pucci (Co-Programmer), Yitian
              Zhang (Co-Programmer), and Zhixiu Zhu (Artist), we were able to create an ambitious game in such a small
              development window.

              My role for this project was the project manager, game designer, and 2D animator.
              As the project manager, my responsibility for my team is to keep track of everyone's task and decide the
              time frame of which a task should be finish. Time management in this project was key, as this was our team's
              first experience with the Unity 3D engine.

                  The issue I faced with my task was the 2D animation part. I used the Live2D Engine for 2D animations as
                  part
                  of gameplay. However,
                  this engine was not meant to be used to create as part of gameplay but as a visual aesthetic such as
                  creating movements in the background.
                  Live2D Engines are mostly used to create animations for a 2D character portrait, and again for visual
                  aesthetic.

                  To get around this, I worked on the animation as if it was a standard animation program, meaning I
                  worked on
                  it
                  by translating body parts manually at a certain time frame to create movements. This also includes the
                  hair
                  of the character
                  which I had to split the hair into multiple sections to simulate a flowing movement instead of moving
                  the
                  entire hair.
                  Then I export the animation in png frames and construct them in Unity as animation by frames.

              While this solution was very clumsily implemented, within Unity Engine it worked great. With great feedback
              about the
              animations from the professors and peers. Live2D Engine is a program that is not very widely popularized but
              it can
              produce some fantastic looking animations when done right.
